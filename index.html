        <h1>HTML Page to be sent to the browser with Express route handling</h1>

        <p>How do you like the routes? Could you easily find your way?</p>
        <p>So far, this project has allowed me to get some practice using express and routes.  In my index.js file, I created a route that sends an HTML file containing the script you are currently reading to the browser.</p>
        <p>To learn more about me, follow the about route by tacking '/about' to the end of localhost:3000 in the URL</p>
